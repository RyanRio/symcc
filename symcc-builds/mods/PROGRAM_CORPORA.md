# Testing Corpora

The following programs are tested.

https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr.git

Download these into either programs32 or programs64, or both, depending on whether the program should be built with 32 bit or 64 bit. Currently only programs specified above will be built.

## Using Tests

Th `unsquash.py` script downlaods a `fuzz-queue` directory which can be used to test the corpora.
